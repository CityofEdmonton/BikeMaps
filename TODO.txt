BikeMaps – Functionality
-	Database backup
-	Intersection search
-	Linking the occurrence of a near-miss, crash, and theft to weather.
-	Bike infrastructure in the legend with bike route and racks
-	Alert emails to include graphics
-	Alert info button - Receive monthly alerts for your riding area. Register to access alert functionality and define an area to track.
-	Prize entry for registered users
-	Sliders and query tools on the website so people can see where recent crashes are or the difference between day and night incidents.
-	Integrate all official crash reports into one layer. When we click on markers the date and source should be shown. For the citizen data maybe the data and object
		the incident occurred with. 
-	Is it possible that when people click on the source of official data that they get metadata. For example if it is ICBC we could say. “Data available for British
		Columbia from 1999 to 2013. Incident characteristics not provided.”
