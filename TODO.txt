##### TO DO

### GENERAL SITE UPDATES
  # HIGHER PRIORITY
    * Track down memory/DOM issues causing site load problems
    * Fix ICBC loading problems
    * Serve some pages over http to get around unsafe site resources warnings (do during new server setup since this will have to be configured then anyway)
    * Colour report buttons / make them more obvious
    * Cleanup index.html code
    * Hide expired hazards on the visualization page
    * Include and flag expired/fixed hazards in the api

  # LOWER PRIORITY
    * Open311 data sharing
    * Display open street map (OSM) bike lanes and bike racks on main map
    * Automate monthly emails of stats page
    * Option to report for different person
    * OAuth2 (Facebook Google+) login options
    * opt in for emails (double opt in if possible)
    * Search engine optimization ie keywords as meta tags?
    * Documentation for future devs
    * Make use of AJAX to prevent unnecessary page redirects (eg when submitting a point, eliminate redirect to index page)
    *	Intersection search
    *	Alert emails to include graphics
    * Improve search (text hard to read, Android problems?)


### HAZARDS MODEL UPDATES
  * Severity rating
  * Short term hazards auto resolve and removed from map (ie weather hazards disappear after 1 day)
  * Long term hazards (eg road condition) can be removed by privileged users (eg municipal workers)
  * Remove injury field


### MOBILE WISH LIST
  * Hazard photos (mobile app)
  * Route tracking (mobile app)
  * Safest route finding algorithm and visualization


### BUGS
  * Broken modal popups on some browsers
  * Date picker does not scroll with modal (bind to something?)
  * Some users reporting blank screen on browsing to site (Probably a non-webkit browser issue that can't be fixed without updating browser/OS older than Windows XP, display error message)
