#TO DO

###HIGHER PRIORITY
* Track down memory/DOM issues
* Try search engine optimization ie keywords as meta tags?
* Add Karen safety information
* Display more data in point popups
* Automate monthly emails of stats page
* Hazard deletion system for resolved hazards (eg broken glass on road)
* Cleanup index.html code
* Cleanup stats.html code a lot ****
* Fullscreen on mobile (sort of done if app is added to homepage, more to do)
* Allow admin point moving on main map page
* Change from blanketed https requests to selected https requests to avoid unsafe script warnings
* Request https admin page maps (browsers are blocking insecure js from display by default)
* Serve some pages over http to get around unsafe site resources warnings
* Broken modal popups on some browsers
* Bigger reporting buttons
* Vertical center sponsors and supporters images

###LOWER PRIORITY
* Expose hazards model as a WFS service (azgs-leaflet? Make WFS via QGIS and add to leaflet?)
* Make API to allow developer access to bikemaps data (WFS again??)
* User login cookies to prevent having to sign in every time
* opt in for emails (double opt in if possible)
* add bikelanes from OCM
* add new alerts badge to navbar bell
* Option to report for different person
* Documentation for future devs
* improve incidents heatmap
* flagged comment alerts for admins
* Pictures of hazards uploading
* Make use of AJAX to prevent unnecessary page redirects
* Change app name
* Clear all button in alerts "mark all as read"
* Kill forum app
*	Intersection search
*	Linking the occurrence of a near-miss, crash, and theft to weather.
*	Alert emails to include graphics
* Improve search (text hard to read, Android problems?)

###BUGS
* Moderate comments > delete button not working
* Date picker does not scroll with modal (bind to something?)
* Leaflet draw does not work for mobile (currently using double tap work-around for mobile)
* Some users reporting blank screen on browsing to site (may be old browser issue, display error message?)
