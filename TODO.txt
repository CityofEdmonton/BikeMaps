Trisalyn TODO
BikeMaps – Functionality
-	Database backup
-	Intersection search
-	Linking the occurrence of a near-miss, crash, and theft to weather.
-	Bike infrastructure in the legend with bike route and racks
-	Alert emails to include graphics
-	Alert info button - Receive monthly alerts for your riding area. Register to access alert functionality and define an area to track.
-	Prize entry for registered users
-	Sliders and query tools on the website so people can see where recent crashes are or the difference between day and night incidents.
-	Integrate all official crash reports into one layer. When we click on markers the date and source should be shown. For the citizen data maybe the data and object
		the incident occurred with. 
-	Is it possible that when people click on the source of official data that they get metadata. For example if it is ICBC we could say. “Data available for British
		Columbia from 1999 to 2013. Incident characteristics not provided.”


From Holland
& Greating message with tour of site on first visit
- "Add an incident marker" tooltip to something else
& Help button hard to see

& Basemap highway colors are too similar to legend colors

- Add "roadway" to collision objects
- Add "prefer not to disclose" or "other" to sex choices
- Change "More than 52 times a year" to "weekly" -> Should "I don't know" be an option?
- Change age category youngest to age to 13

	THEFT FORM
- Add 'Did you file an insurance claim?'
- Add Type of lock?
- Where was bike locked? Garage, bike room, street, sign, etc
- More detailed "was your bike locked answers" -> Locked frame, locked frame and wheel, etc...

	HAZARD FORM
& Confusion about object that presents the hazard -> hard to distinguish one choice
& Add other/explain field
- Description should be before personal details


From Kay
•	some of the crashes may not be collisions, they may be falls
•	injury might be better further classified, e.g.,
	o	not injured
	o	injured, no medical treatment
	o	injured, saw a family doctor
	o	injured, went to hospital emergency department
	o	injured, hospitalized (i.e., stayed overnight in hospital in a department other than emergency)

-	where were you riding your bike might include a few more categories:
	-	on a physically separated bike lane (cycle track)
	-	on a busy street with no bike facilities
	-	on a quiet street
