Trisalyn TODO
BikeMaps – Functionality
-	Database backup
-	Intersection search
-	Linking the occurrence of a near-miss, crash, and theft to weather.
-	Bike infrastructure in the legend with bike route and racks
-	Alert emails to include graphics
-	Alert info button - Receive monthly alerts for your riding area. Register to access alert functionality and define an area to track.
-	Prize entry for registered users
-	Sliders and query tools on the website so people can see where recent crashes are or the difference between day and night incidents.
-	Integrate all official crash reports into one layer. When we click on markers the date and source should be shown. For the citizen data maybe the data and object
		the incident occurred with. 
-	Is it possible that when people click on the source of official data that they get metadata. For example if it is ICBC we could say. “Data available for British
		Columbia from 1999 to 2013. Incident characteristics not provided.”

2. I would suggest that the links from the share button open in a new
window since they are going to external sites. In general, I expect links
within the same web site to open in the same tab, but links to external
sites to open in new tabs.

5. When you search for a word/phrase that returns multiple results, the
text of the results is truncated. Try searching for 'shell' for example.
The list of results should probably expand horizontally to accommodate the
width of the result items or the text in the result items may even need to
wrap if it is sufficiently long.

7. Geolocation frequently doesn't work for me on my home computer. I get a
message saying "Geolocation error: Position acquisition timed out." It
seems to work better from my Android phone however.

8. The search function doesn't seem to work from my Android phone.

10. When using a phone, it would be nice if the address bar could be
hidden as it occupies valuable screen real estate, especially when in
landscape mode.
