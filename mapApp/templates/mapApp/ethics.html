		<p><strong>Letter of informed consent:</strong></p>

		<p>As part of a UVic research project, we are interested in obtaining information regarding your cycling experiences in the Capital Regional District (CRD). In particular we would like to know about any incidents that you have had. The data collected is completely anonymous and answers are multiple choice containing no identifiable information. The survey should take approximately 5 minutes.</p>
		 
		<p>By logging onto this website and answering questions, you are consenting to participate in a study conducted by researchers from the Spatial Pattern Analysis and Research (SPAR) Lab in the Department of Geography at the University of Victoria. All information gathered will be completely anonymous. Volunteers must be 13 years of age or older to participate. Parents or guardians may log the details for participants under the age of 13. Please be advised that once a volunteer participant has submitted their survey, it is impossible to withdraw this data at a later date given that it is fully anonymous. Also, the data may be used in additional future studies.</p>
		 
		<p>The data collected from this research will enable SPAR Lab researchers and graduate students to study the patterns of bike accidents and near misses in the Capital Regional District. Understanding the geographical patterns to risk for cyclists will enable better decisions to be made regarding future transportation plans for the region.</p>
		 
		<p>Funding for this research project has been provided by an NSERC Engage grant to Dr. Trisalyn Nelson. Other project partners providing in kind support include: the CRD, Pedalheads, KidicalMassyyj; the Canadian Automobile Association; Strava.com.
