"Personal details such as age and gender are routinely collected in health "
"research including studies examining cycling injuries (e.g., Cripton et al. "
"2015). In addition, details such as rider experience and gender have been "
"shown to be important predictors of cycling safety and risk (Beck et al. "
"2007). The goal of BikeMaps.org is to gather more comprehensive data to "
"better assess cycling safety and risk. Providing personal details will allow "
"us to more accurately fill in these data gaps."
